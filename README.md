# hello-world
Just another repository

Hi everyone!

Rus is in touch, I love tea, I would drink it in tons (I think I'm literally made of tea). 
I think this is clearly not what I needed to write here, doesn't matter, I do everything according to the example in 5 minutes. 
I think Git is a really good VCS and would like to study it after doing this HW.
